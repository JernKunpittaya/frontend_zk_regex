## Summary

We allow users to easily create circom circuit to reveal submatch. After a few steps on frontend, we can deal with our newly baked circom circuit by

component main { public [in, match_idx] } = Regex(max_msg_byte,max_reveal_byte,group_idx);

where in is the whole text, match_idx is to tell which occurance of a certain submatch we are interested in, and group_idx is to tell which submatch we are interested in.

## Overview

Input: regex, submatches, text  
Output: Return circom that allows us to reveal a specific submatch we defined through frontend.

Data flow and related functions [All for frontend, except the last one for generating circom]

1. Users type regex format like regex = "DKI: (([a-z]=([12/]+); )+)bh"
2. Frontend processes this regex, by simp_regex = helper_required.simplifyRegex
   (to deal with escape and change [] into "or" statements), then let users highlight start and end of each group (inclusive) of this simp_regex. Save the value as submatches e.g.
   const submatches = [
   [5, 75],
   [7, 59],
   [61, 70],
   ];
3. Match all the strings that satisfies regex as a whole. à¸º
   Run
   const simp_graph = gen_dfa.simplifyGraph(regex);

   const matched_dfa = gen_dfa.findSubstrings(simp_graph, text);

   for (const subs of matched_dfa[1]) {

   var matched = text.slice(subs[0], subs[1] + 1);} Very important of +1!!

4. Now for each matched, we start extracting corresponding indexes for each submatch (we can have multiple matched values! aka many match_idx)

   const tagged_simp_graph = gen_tagged_dfa.tagged_simplifyGraph(regex, submatches);

   var tag_result = gen_tagged_dfa.getTaggedResult(text, tagged_simp_graph);

   Note: the rest can be seen in MainPage.js

5. To create Circom, we run
   let circom = gen_circom.gen_circom(regex, submatches);

Note that we can see more tests of calling function in test.js file

## Details

How to creat circom for extracting submatch in regex.

Part 1: we create Tagged DFA. Given Regex, we want to be able to specify a certain submatch in that regex so that we can not only match the whole regex, but also be able to extract that specific submatch from the text as well.

Parameter:

- Regex: Define the whole regex we want to match together with a certain submatch we want to extract from that regex. For this tool, please put parentheses over the submatch you want to extract, again there can be multiple submatches! for example instead of writing regex as "I am [a-z]+, and [0-9]+ yrs old", put it as "I am ([a-z]+), and ([0-9]+) yrs old" in case we want to extract name and age of that person.

  [We can see that with this, we make sure people have well-defined submatch definition, and must not extract submatch of "b)c" from regex "d(a|b)c". Instead they can redefine regex as "d((a|b)c)" and now can extract submatch "((a|b)c)"]

- Submatch: Assume it is already processed by simplifyRegex and simplifyPlus. In case of multiple submatches, we order it in ascending order of the leftmost parentheses of that submatch.

Steps

1. Given regex and submatch, we construct NFA like we usually do, but now for each i-th submatch we create another state in front of the first state included in that submatch and have a transition "Si" leads into that state, while create another state after the last state included in that submatch and have a transition "Ei" connecting between that last state into this state. For other states, just connect to these special Si, Ei states as if they would with the state that Si precedes, or Ei follows.
2. We, then, transform this NFA into its minimized DFA which is unique by theory. However, it is noted that we cannot use this DFA to run DFA that can match tagged because we still have Si, Ei state in this DFA. Although, we take out these Si, Ei states, because during our NFA-to-DFA transformation we always keep in mind of Si, Ei states, when we remove it, the machine may not be DFA anymore i.e. the machine can result in having multiple similar alphabets that transitions out from the same edge like NFA.
3. To take care of this tagged problem, we uses the method explained in https://www.labs.hpe.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-41R1.pdf Basically, we just ignore the notion of +/- and epsilon because we start M1 as the DFA that have Si, Ei transition attached to it. (Note that we do not start the process in paper from scratched NFA because doing so will result in exponential number of states, so we make sure to minimize the state machine into DFA first to be able to have linear complexity in DFA states, which is very critical for circom circuit constraint)

We run this following methods. [All methods are in gen_tagged_dfa.js]

const tagged_simp_graph = tagged_simplifyGraph(regex, submatches);

let m2_graph = M1ToM2(tagged_simp_graph);

let m3_graph = M2ToM3(m2_graph);

let m4_graph = createM4(tagged_simp_graph);

Brief explanation for algo:

tagged_simp_graph is the tagged minimized DFA with Si, Ei attached (we use as m1 in paper).

m2 graph is similar to m1 but have only states that have outgoing transition.

m3 graph is the reverted version of m2 to run on backward text. For each alphabet of revert text that run upon m3 machine, we record the states of m3 machien that the alphabet leads the transition into. We will use these states as the input in m4 machine.

m4 graph is similar to m2 but the transition alphabet is m3 state instead, and for each transition it has register that store the start and end index of string that falls under that certain submatch.

4. After gettting m4 as in paper, we transform the graph that extract submatch by register into specifying which state transition is included in each tag (this process also allows us to detect multiple occurences of strings in the same submatch naturally). Then, we reassign the state number of m3 and m4 to become just plain consecutive numbers.

   let tagged_m4_graph = registerToState(m4_graph);

   let final_m3_m4 = reassignM3M4(m3_graph, tagged_m4_graph);

   console.log("final m3: ", final_m3_m4["final_m3_graph"]);

   console.log("final m4: ", final_m3_m4["final_m4_graph"]);

Part 2: Create Circom. we run dfa 3 times. [high level is as follows]

Steps

1. Run naive minimized DFA without tag version to find the end alphabet of string that matches our regex.
2. With that end alphabet, we run string backward from that alphabet on m3 graph, store the state of m3 that each alphabet into.
3. Use each state we got in m3 as alphabet for transition in m4 graph. [and start running only from the last alphabet that ends in m3 graph (since m3 graph is reversed, the last of it is the first alphabet of the string that matches our regex)]

Note: M3 and M4 are needed in constructing circom because we need both forward and backward running state machines, or else we cannot distinguish extracting (a|b) from between regex (a|b)c and (a|b)d.

However, in this project, we needs the naive minimized DFA without tag to get the first alphabet for m3 to be able to calculate state of m3 graph that each alphabet leads to in circom.
[Likely to be optimized and can remove running this naive non-tagged DFA]

## Limitations

- This project assumes that our regex is well-defined that there is only ONE string that match our regex. (But there can be multiple submatches, and multiple substrings for each submatches in that ONE regex match)
- This project doesn't allow users to decide the algorithm for ambiguous submatch. For example, the text a = b = c, but with submatch [submatch1]=[submatch2], it can be either (a)=(b=c) or (a=b)=c, resulting in ambiguity. In this project, we just choose the first one that we found, but in reality there are tons of ways to define how to break ambiguity. (In paper, they handle ambiguity in submatch by using +/-)

## Optional

- Show final regex matching and what submatches become after expanding +, by running: after_plus = helper_miscel.simplifyPlus(simp_regex, submatches).
  var final_regex = after_plus["regex_show"];
  var final_submatches = after_plus["final_submatches"]; i.e.[
  [ [ 5, 65 ] ],
  [ [ 7, 13 ], [ 36, 42 ] ],
  [ [ 15, 31 ], [ 44, 60 ] ]
  ]
  (inclusive)
